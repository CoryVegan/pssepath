pssepath - Easy PSSE Python coding

whit. (whit.com.au)

pssepath simplifies the code required to setup the Python environment necessary
to use the PSSE API. Importing pssepath at the beginning of the script will
find the install location of PSSE and prepare Python for importing psspy. The
usage of this package (after installation) would be as follows:

import pssepath
import psspy

Another benefit of using pssepath is that it will find the appropriate install
locations on other people's computers, encouraging easy reuse and sharing of
code with colleagues.

Installation:
At the moment, place pssepath.py in the same directory as the code you wish to
run. An easy, global installation is in the works.
